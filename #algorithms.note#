		Asimptotic notations
		--------------------


BIG O NOTATION (Upper bound) 
--------------
f(n) = O(g(n)) means that there exists two constants c>0, n0>0 such that 
0<f(n) <= c*g(n) for all n >= n0;ie f(n) is bounded by g(n).

examples:
	2n^2 = O(n^3) 
	heare the equality is asymatric ie, the LHS NOT EQUAL TO THE RHS.

SET DEFANITION
--------------

O(g(n)) = { f(n) : there exisist two constans c and n0 such that f(n) <= c.g(n)
for all n >= n0}

O(g(n)) is defined as set of all functions f(n) satifying the above property.
2n^2 = O(n^3) means that 2n^2 belongs to the set O(n^2) by the set theoritic 
defanition.


MACRO CONVENTION
----------------

A set in a formula represents an anonimous function in that set.
f(n) = n^3 + O(n^2) means that there is a function h(n) belongs to O(n^2) . such
that f(n) = n^3 + h(n).

Example.
n^2 + O(n) = O(n^2)


BIG OMEGA NOTATION (lower bound)
------------------
OMEGA(g(n)) = { f(n) : such that there exists two constants c and n0, such that
0<c.g(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0};
